    <p>
        A unconference about <b>collaborative tools</b>
        - <i> which tools? which rules?</i>.
        We will discuss what are the secrets to use them
        successfully in a scientific environment.<br>
        Which problems do we encounter? is it a problem
        with the tools? is it a generational barrier?
        or there are governamental rules that prevent us
        to use them?
    </p>
